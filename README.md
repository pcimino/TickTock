HTML5 Stop Watch demo leveraging the Enyo Bootplate Application template for packaged Enyo. This is based on an app I built and blogged about calle d **TopWatch**. [The code is here](https://github.com/pcimino/TopWatch_Build).

The animated canvas seems to have issues on some platforms. Probably will work eventually as IE & Firefox  and Webkit all approach a common HTML5 standard. FOr now some things don't work correctly. Eventually I may need to fix orientation and size detection as well, if the existing code doesn't use the future preferred standard.
